# Welcome

Data Science is an absurdly broad field, thus, many practicing data scientists end up using *far* more tools and methods than they could ever hope to become experts in. So, we tend to find and save links to resources online that help us to understand what we are doing a bit better, or that give us a framework (sometimes a template) for the work we are doing.

The purpose of this JupyterBook is to provide a *living* repository of notes on data science tools and methods that I find particularly useful. In a way, it is a collection of reminders, templates, and explanations that anyone interested can refer to later. **By no means is this meant to provide textbook-level depth on anything** â€” of course, that is the purpose of textbooks. Instead, this repository focuses on a *practical* level of understanding, with references to textbooks or documentation for a more comprehensive look.

> Since the field of data science changes so quickly, I hope the content in this repository will as well. To that end, please **open an issue** (click the little GitHub icon on the top-right of the page) if you find anything that should be corrected, updated, removed, or added. Thanks!
