Reference and notes for an efficient Data Science framework and workflow.

## Initial Setup

Before working on your first data science project ...

1. Since, invariably, you'll use Python for most of your work, install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). (The full Anaconda distribution is bloated and can get quite cumbersome.)
2. Run `conda update --all` (you might consider running this twice â€” package resolutions are weird).
3. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you haven't already. Then, [download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (in my humble opinion, this is the most efficient way to interface with GitHub for most data science work).
    - [This is a great resource for Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository).
4. Create a "Projects" folder somewhere convenient on your computer. You can name the folder whatever you like; for example, I have a "GitStuff" folder in my home directory (i.e., on a Mac, this is a folder in the same directory as *Movies* and *Pictures*, etc.). Here is where you'll put all data science project folders.
5. (Optional) [Install R and R-Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for statistical analysis (e.g., rigorous hypothesis testing, study design, etc.).
