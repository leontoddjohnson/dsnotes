# Definition of Front End

There are so many tools that data scientists use, and many of them are also used by non-data scientists, maybe closer to the end-user of data science products. The Front End section here refers to anything I consider to be more associated with the end-user (e.g., business professional) in mind. E.g., this might include notes for Tableau, Looker, etc.

This section is under construction.
