# Definition of Backend

Of course, anything a data scientist does could be considered "backend". But, in *dsnotes*, the term "backend" refers to any tools I consider more associated with the work done by a data *engineer* or a software developer. This includes, but is not limited to, the operating system (e.g., bash, Docker), data infrastructure (e.g., snowflake, SQL, etc.), D3, React, Java, etc.
