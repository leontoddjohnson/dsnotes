# Overview

Currently, dsnotes is divided into four main sections:

1. Python
2. R
3. Frontend
4. Backend
5. Theory

> Of course, this organization is subject to change.

**Python** and **R** have their own sections, as they are (arguably) the primary programming languages for data science operations, where 95% of work is done. This leaves everything else to the **[Frontend](../3_frontend/3_definition_.md)** and the **[Backend](../4_backend/3_definition_.md)**. The **Theory** section contains theoretical explanations for various methods and concepts found in data science.

**Data Science should be always done with Ethics and Epistemological concerns in mind.** My position is that these should not be separate subjects, but rather they should be merged into one in the same way that Literature should use the rules of grammar. To that end, I will try to share any ethical and epistemological caveats wherever applicable throughout *dsnotes*.

## Initial Setup

Before working on any data science project ...

1. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you haven't already. Then, [download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (in my humble opinion, this is the most efficient way to interface with GitHub for most data science work).
    - [This is a great resource for Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository).
2. Create a "Projects" folder somewhere convenient on your computer. You can name the folder whatever you like; for example, I have a "GitStuff" folder in my home directory (i.e., on a Mac, this is a folder in the same directory as *Movies* and *Pictures*, etc.). Here is where you'll put all future data science project git repositories.
